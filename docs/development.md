## Working in the `kinghts-watch` repo

2. Running tests:

    ```bash
      cd test/dummy
      bin/rails test
    ```
3. Push your local changes to Github.
    * Once you have updated you master branch with the latest changes, you can follow these steps to create a new branch, make changes, and push it to GitHub.

        ```sh
        git checkout -b branchname     # create a branch where you will commit your changes
        git add .                      # stage the changes
        git commit -m 'commit message'        # commit the changes
        git push origin branchname     # push your local branch to GitHub and then create a Pull Request
        ```
